### What is the package/library?
The package that this exploartion activity uses is axios, an HTTP request library that can access information and data on the internet. This library is the same as the one used in the third javascript programming question.
### How do you run the program
If you have already completed Q3 for javascript, there is no need to install any new packages. Just download the code and run
'''
node EA2.js
'''
Otherwise, you will need to install axios
'''
npm install axios

The above should have everything set for you!
